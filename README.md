# OpenTable Clone

**THIS PROJECT IS MORE OF A PRACTICE RUN AND EDUCATIONAL ENDEAVOR RATHER THAN THE REAL DEAL. JUST SO YOU KNOW, I DON'T OWN ANY OF THE GRAPHICS, VIDEOS, OR OTHER STUFF USED HERE. THIS ISN'T CONNECTED TO OR APPROVED BY THE OFFICIAL SOURCE IN ANY FANCY WAY. SO, KEEP IN MIND, IT'S ALL IN THE SPIRIT OF LEARNING AND NOT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT.**

This is a full-stack OpenTable clone created as a part of this [course](https://udemy.com/course/the-nextjs-13-bootcamp-the-complete-developer-guide) on Udemy. Feel free to clone and run it on your system using the following commands

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> Please note that the front-end is not fully responsive as the main focus of the course was to learn Next.js 13.
